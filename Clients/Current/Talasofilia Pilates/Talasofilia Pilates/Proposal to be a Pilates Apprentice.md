### About project

Hi Maria,  
  

How are you? I hope you’re doing great. I miss your classes!  
  
I’ve been thinking about what we talked about back in Puerto. We discussed me learning how to teach Pilates from you. The more I think about it, the more interested I am.  
  
Is this something you are open to? If you are, let me know and we can have a larger discussion.  
  
I don’t have much (any) money right now, so I’m hoping we can continue collaborating on the website, photos, and marketing in exchange for one-on-one mentoring to teach me how to teach pilates.  
  
Here are a few things I can offer:  
  
- We can build out a payment and class scheduling portal for your website.  
- I’ll bring my camera and continue taking photos that you can use for marketing.  
- I can help manage your social media marketing via TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.  
- Once you’re comfortable in my ability, maybe I can teach a class in your studio and give you a percentage of the income to help pay for the mentoring?  
  
If you have any other ideas, I’m open to hearing your thoughts and figuring out how we can both benefit.  
  
I know you’re going to be gone in May, but if you’re open to this, we can come back to Puerto in June if that works for you!  
  
Let me know and we can stay in touch.  
  
Thank you,  
Daniela ❤️
