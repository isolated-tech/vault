### About project

Right now, clicking a green class within the calendar view does nothing. Itâ€™s green when the signed in user is signed up for that particular class.  
  
In this case, when the user clicks the green, the Book a Class modal should still appear, but it should say somewhere on the modal that the user is already signed up for this class.
