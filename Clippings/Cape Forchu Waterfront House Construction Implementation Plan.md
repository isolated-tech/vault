_The architect is the foundation of your entire project - you cannot get permits, construction loans, or start building without professional architectural plans. This should be your #1 priority after the initial municipal contact._

---

_This plan assumes no major regulatory changes. Stay in regular contact with municipal officials and monitor for any new coastal protection bylaws._
