By law, short-term accommodations must register to operate in Nova Scotia if they provide accommodations for 28 days in a row or less. For example, if you provide accommodations for a few days (or a few weeks) at a time, you need to register.

You don’t have to register your short-term accommodation if you provide:

- only long-term accommodations (like a year-to-year lease, month-to-month lease or more than 28 days in a row)
- accommodations at campgrounds that are not roofed (like campsites where travellers bring their own tents or trailers)
- accommodations that are only for temporary workers (like temporary workers in healthcare and building trades)

### Types of short-term accommodations

The types of short-term accommodations that need to register include:

- primary residence short-term rentals
- commercial short-term rentals
- traditional tourist accommodations

A primary residence is the home where you live as an owner or tenant. It’s also the address you use for bills, identification, taxes and insurance. A primary residence short-term rental can be your whole home when you’re away or a guest room.

A commercial short-term rental is a short-term rental in a dwelling (like a home, backyard or secondary suite, condominium unit or apartment) that’s suitable as long-term housing but is rented on a short-term basis. It’s also not a primary residence.

A traditional tourist accommodation is an accommodation that’s traditionally associated with tourists (like hotels, motels, inns, hostels, resorts, bed and breakfasts, personal vacation homes, cottages, dormitory-style rooms and unusual lodgings like yurts, domes and recreational vehicles).

### Registration number

You get a registration number after you register your short-term accommodation and pay the registration fee (keep the number for your records). You need the registration number to advertise your accommodation on short-term accommodations marketing platforms (like Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and Vrbo).

### Transferring a registration number to a new owner

If you’re selling an already registered short-term accommodation, you can’t transfer the registration to the new owner. The new owner needs to register the accommodation before they start operating the accommodation.

## Eligibility

All short-term accommodations need to register to operate in Nova Scotia. You need to register your short-term accommodation before you start operating the accommodation.

You need to register each short-term accommodation location with a different civic address (each location gets a separate registration number). You can register multiple accommodations at the same time.

## How long it takes

It should take 2 to 3 weeks to get your registration number. It can take longer if more information is needed or if your application doesn’t include all the required information.

## Cost

The cost of registration is based on the type of short-term accommodation.
