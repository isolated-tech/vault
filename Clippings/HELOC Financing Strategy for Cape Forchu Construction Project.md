    - Maximum HELOC: $260,000 (65% of $400,000)
    - This would likely cover your entire construction project!

### **Key Requirements:**

- **Credit Score**: 680+ for best rates, minimum 600
- **Home Ownership**: Must own the Cape Forchu property

## Risk Management

### **Interest Rate Risk:**

**Mitigation**: HELOCs have variable rates tied to Prime

- **Current environment**: Rates may decrease in 2025
- **Protection strategy**: Some HELOCs allow converting portions to fixed rate
- **Budget planning**: Plan for potential rate increases

### **Property Value Risk:**

**Mitigation**: Coastal properties generally hold value well

- **Your advantage**: Waterfront property typically appreciates
- **Construction value-add**: Building will increase total property value
- **Conservative borrowing**: Don't max out the 65% limit

### **Cash Flow Management:**

**Strategy**: Interest-only payments during construction

- **Lower payments**: Only pay interest on amount used
- **Flexible repayment**: Can pay principal anytime to reduce interest
- **Post-construction**: Convert to fixed repayment schedule or maintain flexibility

## Tax Advantages

### **Potential Tax Benefits:**

- **Construction interest**: May be deductible if building rental property
- **Home improvement**: Interest may be deductible for primary residence improvements
- **Business use**: If any portion is business use, interest may be deductible
- **Consult tax professional**: Verify specific deductions for your situation
