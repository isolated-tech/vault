## 1\. - Introduction

This document describes how to use the Genius Sports Live Viewer with NFL matches. It covers the basics of American Football, as well as how to understand and follow the information displayed in the Live Viewer. If you get stuck there is a F.A.Q and general comments section at the bottom.

## 2\. - Flow of American Football

## 2.1 - Basics

The objective of an attacking team (the team in possession of the ball) is to score points by passing, carrying, or kicking the ball into the opponent’s end zone. The method of achieving this objective will depend on different circumstances: The current down, the current yard objective and the yards to go (to reach the opponent’s end zone). A team has 4 downs (4 *attempts*) to progress at least 10 yards. If they progress past these 10 yards, then they start from the 1st down again.

A drive is a series of plays that happen when a team has the possession of the ball until they score, they punt the ball or they lose the possession by any means. A play is each action of the game that follows a snap until the game stops.

## 2.2 - The Play

### 2.2.1 - Structure

During normal gameplay (see the list of actions below that do not follow standard procedures), the play follows a fairly standard structure. The attacking team will prepare its formation (if they were to kick, punt or attempt a field goal, the kicking team would be in the pitch), then they will snap (which starts the clock and the play) and then attempt to progress 10 yards. Passing the ball to an attacking player or attempting to rush are the two standard courses of action. The play ends when the ball is no longer in play. In example, following a tackle by the defending team that stopped the attack, the ball goes out of bounds or a team scores. After any of these actions and, depending on what happened, the new situation is updated (plays, yards to go, etc.)

### 2.2.2 - Other Type of Actions

These actions do not follow the standard gameplay flow. They usually involve a type of kick with the possession of the ball changing:

- Punt
- Kickoff
- Field Goal (can be blocked)

### 2.2.3 - Current Down

***Example:** Down - 1st, 10 yards to go @47 yards; Yards to Endzone - 53 yards to go*

This message shows what is the situation in the current down that is about to happen.

## 2.3 - Scoring

There are four ways to score points:

## 2.4 - Kicks, punts, field goals

Depending on different circumstances, one team may kick or punt or attempt a field goal.

## 3.2 - The Event Feed

### 3.2.1 - Description

The NFL feed follows a cyclical flow. The attacking team will start the play from a specific position in the pitch (*Yards to Endzone*) in a specific situation (*Downs* and *Yards to Go*). Then they will *Snap*, starting the play, try to progress with the ball with different courses of action (*Attacking Team Action*) and then, following this play, there will be an outcome, which will be the new *Yards to Endzone and Play Situation*.

As every yard counts, there will be constant updates to the *Yards to Endzone* and *Yards to Go.* There will also be updates to other important data points, like *Attempted Pass* and any data point that may affect the clock, like *Snap*. Therefore, the user can expect continuous modifications to the data points happening simultaneously with the ongoing play.

### 3.2.4 - Risks

Risks are used when there is a chance of something altering the score or the outcome of the previous or next play happening.

Additionally to the Risks Widgets change colors based on the YardsToEndzone value for the team in Possession

- **RED - When YTE value is between 0 and 20 and when Data is not Reliable**
- **AMBER - When YTE value is between 21 and 40**
- **GREEN - When YTE value is above 40**
- **WHITE - YTE value is not available**

### 3.2.5 - Modifications and Updates

Because a single yard can be the difference between a 4th down or a 1st & 10, constant modifications will be delivered. The modifications to the main actions will be updating:

- The clock time
- The yardage (Yards to Go, Yards to End Zone)
- Whether an action is confirmed
- Additional information

Modifications of same actions e.g down, pass are grouped and can be expanded by clicking on the row. Not all events are expandable, only those that have been modified at least once.

## 4\. - Following the Game

## 4.1 - Play by Play

From the ***Down / Yards To Go / Yards to End Zone*** is possible to infer the outcome of the previous action. Understanding this will allow the user to understand the flow of the game, even without knowing the course of action of the attacking team, whether they decided to attempt a pass or to rush forward.
