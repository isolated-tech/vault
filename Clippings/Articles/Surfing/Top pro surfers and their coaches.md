Top pro surfers and their coaches

Written by Craig Jarvis

Published on

Most coaches on tour today are ex professional surfers and seasoned veterans. Think of it as a hierarchy of sorts - whoever has been the most successful on tour are the guys you want in your corner. They come equipped with the type of knowledge and experience you simply cannot buy.

Ex Tour surfer Chris Gallagher was one of the smartest surfers on tour, he has worked closely with the Hobgood brothers and the likes of Brett Simpson and Bobby Martinez. He is highly regarded as one of the best technical experts and analysts in the sport today. He dissects every in and out from heat tactics to equipment to hard work and focus, he was fundamental in Jordy’s late season surge last year, and with the hunger in Jordy right now and the momentum he's carrying after the win at Bells, expect fireworks for the rest of the season. More on Gally below:

Big wave legend, the once-captain in the Billabong Odyssey for the search for the 100ft wave, and a thoughtful tactician in his processes to coaching. He has Kolohe Andino and Lakey Peterson on his books, and they're both on point at the moment. Snips used to compete back in the day, and even got a cover of Surfer Magazine, but to be honest, he wasn't the most dynamic surfer out there and he would be the first to admit it. His skills were all in shrewd tactics and heat knowledge and skills. Which makes him the perfect coach for a generation of surfers who are all brilliantly talented and the only differentiating factor being the way they compete. Kolohe has matured tremendously under Snip’s tutorage, and Lakey is one of the most exciting female surfers in the world today.

Coincidentally Gerr is Snip’s one-time big wave tow partner and long-time friend. Gerr is diametrically opposite to Mike in that he was and is loud, flamboyant and outspoken. He is opinionated, he knows what surfers need, and he has been coaching and mentoring Connor Coffin for many years.

“Surfers need to surf, not work,” said Gerr in a recent online article. “I’d rather watch someone surf than someone work on their surfing.” The man was number 2 in the world once upon a time, so he does have chops. Connor has matured into a dynamic and intelligent competitor who knows when to speak out and when to keep his mouth shut. He is also of the extremely talented type, and it would be a matter of time before he becomes one of the best competitive surfers in the world.

On paper it appears that this is an unusual match, but if you dig deeper it all starts making sense. Ross is from Hawaii and he has been a neighbor and mentor – kind of - to the fatherless Florence family for a while. He’s a great surfer and has a level head on him, never seems to be flustered and would be the ideal candidate for coach and mentor. He’s also incredibly adept in dealing with and understanding media, and this could be a great help to the somewhat shy JJF. It also stands to reason that his job won’t be that difficult. John John has just begun a winning streak, and Ross might have to do nothing but sit around and watch and have a few spare boards ready.

He surfs for Ireland and has had a long and difficult relationship with surfing, which seems to be coming good now. Last year he coached Wilko through an extended dream season that went a little bit southwards later in the year, but ended up with a very respectful top five result. Even more with Tyler Wright, who went on to win the crown. It was amazing to witness Micro tell Tyler to calm down while she was sitting at a sucky bank when down the beach others were getting left bombs. Turns out she only needed two waves, and there was plenty of time for those two bombs to come through.

To assist and take on the coaching of Owen must have been quite a wake-up call for Micro, as the lanky lad was recovering and was a bit short on muscles, vocabulary and memory, but they persevered as a team through the initial stages of competition in 2017. Taking into account the fact that in February doctors were still skeptical that Owen would surf again let alone compete, it was dynamic to witness his victory over so many highly skilled surfers. The one skill that Micro instills in everyone is that of tenacity. After battling for many years as a professional surfer, Micro got his big break and promptly injured his back so badly at Restaurants that he was sidelined for a year and received no wildcard or compensation. He knows what it’s like to struggle and to fight back. If he gives this character to his students then he has already done enough.
