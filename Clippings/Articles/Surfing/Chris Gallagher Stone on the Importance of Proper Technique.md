**“There were no coaches when I was a kid, especially where I grew up,”** explains Chris Gallagher Stone. “I watched videotapes, that’s how I learned about angles of attack and how to really set up a wave.”

As the ’90s roared in, Gally’s preoccupation with technique helped escort him onto the world tour. At the time, the idea of having a surf coach was laughable, so while out on the road he and the likeminded Brad Gerlach became obsessive technique geeks.

“We would get totally deep into it, breaking down every little thing,” laughs Gally.

After his time on tour, Gally relocated from his native Santa Cruz to Hawaii, where he made the next natural career step: team manager and surfboard builder. Working for O’Neill in Hawaii, he started mentoring his team on all of the various technical intricacies of technique that he had contemplated on tour and discussed with Ger.

A couple years later, in 2008, he received a phone call from Damien Hobgood. Florida’s favorite twin brothers were reaching out to see if he’d be interested in lending some of his expertise to their efforts on tour.

“They were looking for some help, specifically in right pointbreaks,” explains Gally. “I had done well at some rights and grew up in the land of right points, so they kind of saw me as somebody that could help them in that regard.”

“They’re great guys. CJ was just like, ‘Hey, tell me what to do and I’ll do it.’ He’d just come off kind of a funky year and was looking for something to change it up. You can never stop learning, but that was an intensive couple of years with them.”

Going on to work with Brett Simpson, the Gudauskas brothers and Josh Kerr, Gally’s spent his fair share of time traveling the world scrutinizing the world’s best. Today he’s settled back in Hawaii, shaping surfboards and watching his family grow. He’s also now working with the talented, up-and-coming Marshall brothers.

Surfline convinced him to put down the planer long enough to help all of us surf a little better. Here’s what he had to say.

**Technique means…**

It can be as simple as a set-up, a ready position. People will have their go-to approach, but rethinking that for specific situations is important. For example, there are different hand positions that can help with weight distribution. Technique can be your set-up, it can be the way you load — the way you load your bottom turn and the way you load your top turn. It’s how to throw your tail, how to throw a layback, or a wrap-slap, wizard-sleeve kind of thing like Kelly. It’s also angles of attack. It’s where you’re looking to maximize power. All of that is tied together. That keeps variety in your turns, as well as power and explosiveness. Technique tightens it all up.

**The most common mistake is…**

Getting the foot far enough on the tail should always be the number one priority. You’ll see people that are a little sticky with their turns at the start of a wave but get better as they go on, that’s because their back foot gets further and further back as they go. That holds true for an amateur or a pro. That’s a real glaring one.

**Good technique starts…**

Getting into the proper stance and learning how to make a proper bottom turn are the fundamental building blocks. Making sure that you’re not getting your back arm too high is often overlooked, but extremely important. A high back arm can make your shoulders dip, which can then make you front-footed. The high back arm on the backside bottom turn and frontside carve can lead to a myriad of problems in terms of consistency and performance.

**A good turn means…**

Leading with the body. Reversing the body backwards to do the turn, as opposed to letting the body lead the board through the turn is a huge problem. It’s common for some of the pros, but it’s definitely something you see a lot in novice and intermediate surfers. It’s comparable to skateboarding, where it’s really easy to backside kick turns on a skate ramp, but once you go to do a frontside kick turn it feels really awkward. You have to very much lead your body through it first. Learning to get that body ahead of the board is key to really powerful forehand surfing.

**The importance of form…**

Bad form is a rush to create speed. You see a lot of people are slapping and pumping off of their front foot, leaning forward trying to get into the next section. What I’m saying is let the wave come to you. Take your time. Check your stance. Let your board run. Stand over your board, don’t lean forward. That’s a huge thing that your average surfer will do. Another skateboard analogy would be if you were on a skateboard and trying to generate speed you wouldn’t start hopping on your front foot and leaning forward to go faster, you would start kick turning or pumping the board. You can only go as fast as the board’s going, and to generate that speed you have to stay over your board.

**Equipment wise, surfers should…**

A lot of average surfers will compensate for technical inefficiencies with foam and flatness. So they aren’t as back footed as a pro or somebody that’s been surfing their whole life. Flatter and fatter is always your friend. And then it helps with paddling, obviously. The more waves you catch the more fun you have, the faster you go, etc. Then if you start to feel like you’re not getting ahead of yourself, that you’re staying above your board, then start to add rocker and decrease volume. But in places like California and the East Coast, don’t be scared to go flat and fat. If you’re struggling catching waves, or making it through to the reform, widen it and flatten it, that’s kind of the general rule.

**Always remember to…**

Keep your foot on the tail. That’s number one. I can’t say it enough. You have to make sure your back foot is squared up and solid over the back of the board. Second is stay low and learn correct body positions frontside and backside so there’s proper weight distribution.
