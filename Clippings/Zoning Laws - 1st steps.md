Start with MODY’s Development Office: confirm zoning, hire pros, then submit permits.

Below is a practical, step‑by‑step path to get from “idea” to a permit to build a coastal home at Cape Forchu (Municipality of the District of Yarmouth). I’ve included who to call, what to prepare, and where to submit.

0) Confirm your jurisdiction and the right counter  

Cape Forchu is in the Municipality of the District of Yarmouth (MODY), not the Town. Your permitting and zoning contacts are at MODY’s Development & Inspection Office, 932 Highway 1, Hebron, NS B5A 5Z5. Phone: 902‑742‑9691. Office hours: Mon–Fri, 8:00–5:00. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection)

- MODY Development & Inspection main page (permits, zoning, subdivision): https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection. Phone 902‑742‑9691. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection)
- MODY Building Permit FAQ (application content, review flow, inspections): https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)
- MODY staff directory (Senior Building Official and team): https://munyarmouth.ca/component/contact/category/municipal-staff. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/component/contact/category/municipal-staff?Itemid=101](https://munyarmouth.ca/component/contact/category/municipal-staff?Itemid=101)

  

1) Zoning and site constraints check (before design)

  

What to do

- Call or email the Development Office. Ask for the Development Officer to confirm your PID’s zone, permitted residential use, any overlays, and whether coastal flood/erosion rules in the Land Use By-law affect your lot. Phone: 902‑742‑9691. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection)
- Download MODY’s Land Use By-law and Zoning Maps to see your zone and any coastal-related provisions that affect setbacks, height, or special approvals. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/government/by-laws](https://munyarmouth.ca/government/by-laws)

  

Where to look

- Land Use By‑law (PDF) and Schedule A Zoning Maps (PDF) under By‑laws: https://munyarmouth.ca/government/by-laws. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/government/by-laws](https://munyarmouth.ca/government/by-laws)

  

Tip

- Bring your PID and a sketch; staff can flag if a Development Permit is needed prior to the Building Permit and what drawings are required. Their FAQ outlines the sequence and documentation. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)

  

2) Line up your core professionals

  

You’ll likely need:

- A Nova Scotia Land Surveyor (site plan, boundaries, top-of-bank, finished-floor elevation, CGVD2013 elevation shots). Find licensed surveyors via the Association of Nova Scotia Land Surveyors “Find a Surveyor.” Phone (association): 902‑469‑7962. https://ansls.ca (Find A Surveyor). [​⁠https://ansls.ca/](https://ansls.ca/)
- A residential designer/architect (Part 9 homes don’t always require an architect, but professional drawings speed approvals). Find firms via the Nova Scotia Association of Architects directory: https://nsaa.ns.ca/members-firms/. [​⁠https://nsaa.ns.ca/members-firms/](https://nsaa.ns.ca/members-firms/)
- An engineer if required (foundation, coastal floodproofing, unusual structures, or if requested by the Building Official). Contact Engineers Nova Scotia for local P.Eng. info: 902‑429‑2250, info@engineersnovascotia.ca, https://engineersnovascotia.ca/about-us/contact-us/. [​⁠https://engineersnovascotia.ca/about-us/contact-us/](https://engineersnovascotia.ca/about-us/contact-us/)

  

Why this matters

- MODY can request professional design/field review based on site conditions, size, or complexity; their FAQ and the province’s Code require inspections at specific build stages. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)

  

3) Septic and services early check (very important on the coast)

  

If you don’t have municipal sewer/water:

- On‑site sewage (septic) requires a provincial “On Site Sewage Disposal Approval” through Nova Scotia Environment and Climate Change (NSECC). The application must be supported by a design from a qualified person. Head Office: 902‑424‑3600. Application and details: https://novascotia.ca/sns/paal/nse/paal178.asp. [​⁠https://novascotia.ca/sns/paal/nse/paal178.asp](https://novascotia.ca/sns/paal/nse/paal178.asp)
- Provincial On‑Site Sewage Standard and roles (qualified person, installers): https://www.novascotia.ca/nse/wastewater/on.site.sewage.disposal.asp. [​⁠https://www.novascotia.ca/nse/wastewater/on.site.sewage.disposal.asp](https://www.novascotia.ca/nse/wastewater/on.site.sewage.disposal.asp)

  

MODY’s Building Official can withhold a building permit until your on‑site sewage approval is in place (or municipal connections arranged). Confirm early to avoid delays. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)

  

4) Prepare the “plans” package

  

Minimums you should expect to include (MODY FAQ):

- Site Plan (surveyed): lot lines, setbacks, driveway, existing/proposed buildings, distances to top‑of‑bank, finished floor elevations in CGVD2013 (ask your surveyor to note datum explicitly). [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)
- Architectural Drawings: floor plans, elevations, sections; for coastal sites, note finished-floor height and any floodproofing details if applicable. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)
- Structural/Foundation details as needed (engineer-stamped if outside prescriptive Part 9). [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)
- Septic approval or proof of municipal services. [​⁠https://novascotia.ca/sns/paal/nse/paal178.asp](https://novascotia.ca/sns/paal/nse/paal178.asp)
- Any documents the Development Officer requests (e.g., development permit, coastal-specific notes from the Land Use By-law). [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection)

  

How to know exactly what they need

- The MODY Building Permit FAQ lists what to submit and clarifies that interior work typically needs floor plan + cross section; exterior/new builds also need site plan + elevations. For bigger/complex projects, an architect/engineer is required. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)

  

5) Submit for permits

  

Sequence at MODY

- Many projects need a Development Permit (zoning compliance) before the Building Permit. The same Development & Inspection Office handles both. Bring your completed package to the office or coordinate submission as advised by staff. Phone: 902‑742‑9691. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection)
- Building Permit application: submit drawings, site/septic info, and pay fees. The application is reviewed against the Nova Scotia Building Code Regulations and MODY’s Land Use By‑law. Expect comments if revisions are needed. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)

  

Where to go/contact

- MODY Development & Inspection Office, 932 Highway 1, Hebron, NS B5A 5Z5. Phone: 902‑742‑9691. Staff list includes the Senior Building Official (Dwayne Roberts) and Building Official (Marc McNeil). https://munyarmouth.ca/component/contact/category/municipal-staff. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/component/contact/category/municipal-staff?Itemid=101](https://munyarmouth.ca/component/contact/category/municipal-staff?Itemid=101)

  

6) Inspections and occupancy

- Call inspections at required stages (footings, framing, insulation/vapour barrier, plumbing, before occupancy, etc.). MODY FAQ outlines the typical checkpoints. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)
- You’ll receive an occupancy permit after final compliance is verified—don’t move in before that. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)

  

7) Coastal specifics to bake into your design workflow

- MODY’s Land Use By‑law and zoning maps govern coastal setbacks, height, and any coastal overlays in the municipality; confirm your coastal buffer/erosion setback and any required minimum elevations early with the Development Officer. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/government/by-laws](https://munyarmouth.ca/government/by-laws)
- Expect to prove finished‑floor elevation in CGVD2013 (ask your surveyor to shoot benchmarks) and to show horizontal setbacks from the top of bank on your site plan. [​⁠https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq](https://munyarmouth.ca/services/development-inspection/building-permit-and-taxation-faq)

If you want, I can pull your PID, read the zoning layer, and extract the exact coastal setbacks and any height/elevation items that will constrain your design—then translate that into a drawing checklist for your surveyor and designer.
