Fixed the squeal on the Corolla. I put in a new serpentine belt and the squeak went away. I wasn't confident this would actually fix it - the old one I took out looked fine to me. But who knows, maybe it was a little too big.

Went for a swim at a new beach with Dany today in Puerto Rico - Sandy's Beach.
It was a bit windy and super hot out, but we found a nice bit of shade beneath a coconut tree and it was lovely.

Laid in the hammock outside and watched some content about creating a successful Youtube channel. It rained really hard and all of the cats cuddled near the sliding door - dad, mom, white dad, and the 3 kittens (snowflake, hiss, and muffin).

Now I'm afking some slayer with all my newly acquired prayer pots from pickpocketing master farmers during standup and exploring a bit of Youtube ideas.
