## Voicescri.pt

**Why:**
I want to be able to program apps completely handsfree.

Living out of an RV full-time, traveling around the western states of the United States with my wife. Long hours on the road made my mind wander often with fun ideas, and I wanted the ability to build them while driving. 

**How:**
OpenAI released their [realtime voice agent](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-realtime/), allowing programmers to bring OpenAI's Voice Agent into their own application.

This + Claude Code's Github Action + Tools for out Voice Agent enabled my vision - completely hands free coding.

**Amount made:**
$0. I did some basic Reddit, Hackernews, and Youtube marketing but in the end, I only got a few hundred visitors and 0 sales.

**Where I went wrong:**
I believe the application had far too complicated of an onboarding.
1. Github OAuth + Repository permissions
2. OpenAI API Key for Voice Agent
3. Claude Code Max Subscription for Github Action
4. Github Action .yml file committed into codebase

These 4 steps are highly sensitive and technical. You must **really** want to use this application and I don't believe my landing page, docs, and onboarding did enough to convince users to do this.

**Future:**
I've recently learned how to cut the onboarding down significantly.

I'll still need Github permissions to get access to code if we want to push code to a user's Github. Just writing this makes me think even this step is optional - I can have the agent write code and only if the user wants the code to persist can we create the permissions needed to push to their repository.

The other steps can be completely eliminated now that I know how to run Claude Code in my own secure and private sandboxes. Instead, just opting for a simpler credit-based system that users can buy into.

## Twittervim

Twittervim was never meant to 

## Humanize.rs

**Why:**
Humanizers was absolutely a "get rich quick" attempt at indie-hacking. Patt Walls of Starter Story interviews people often who simply copied a working business model.

Then I saw a Tweet about a faceless TikTok account going viral with this idea. I figured it would be easy to replicate, so I built it with an emphasis on UI and beauty.

**How:**
Typical shadcn + nextjs stack
Used Claude Code to vibe up the prompts and humanization tactics

**Amount made:**
$0.
This was our first attempt at creating a dedicated content channel (TikTok). My wife re-created multiple viral posts that have worked for others in the humanizer space.

This worked well and we actually got quite a few users onto the app.

**Where I went wrong:**
Turns out, AI humanizing is not easy. I went into this thinking it was simply a ChatGPT wrapper with something along the lines of "Don't be AI - write like a human".

Obviously that's not the case. It appears there's a ton of post-processing of the ai generated content that is required to bypass AI checkers.

This is not an area I am passionate about. I really just wanted to test a proven market space to see if it worked - the user acquisition actually worked really well, but the technical side did not and I was not interested enough in solving it to continue.

**Future:**
This site will probably be deprecated. But, I do like the UI and think that worked well, so I will be re-using it as a template for future projects.
