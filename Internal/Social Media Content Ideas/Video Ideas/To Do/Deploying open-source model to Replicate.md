I've been trying to build on https://replicate.com/jaaari/kokoro-82m, the only Kokoro-82m model on Replicate, but it's an older version of the model with less voices and supported languages.

Walking through a deployment would be informative for myself. There are unknowns that the Replicate documentation does not cover:

- How do I determine the dependencies of the model?
- What should I do with the `predict.py`?
