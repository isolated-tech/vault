## What Components I recommend for this system:(I Make A Commission For Purchases Made Through The Links Below)

## Buy 400 watts of Either Glass or Flexible solar panels

| ## Glass Solar Panels(recommended)  [![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/richsolar200watt12voltsolarpanel1-1000x1000-crop-center_orig.jpg)](https://richsolar.com/products/100-watt-solar-panel?ref=h-cvbzfahsek)  **Pros:** - Cheap - Extremely durable (can handle snow, rain, heat for years!) - Easy to mount on a vehicle's roof. [Click Here to learn how](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/solar-panel-mounts.html) - Last 25+ years, no problem    **Cons:** - Heavy. Typically around 16 pounds for a 100 watt solar panel - Can cause a huge amount of aerodynamic drag to your vehicle - Mounting glass panels to the roof of a moving vehicle is typically a bad idea. If one of these falls off your roof, someone can die. Make sure you mount all panels properly. - Requires air flow under the panel. Just an inch or so, not much, but it is necessary.    **[400 watts of Glass Solar Panels   Click here to purchase](https://richsolar.com/products/100-watt-solar-panel?ref=h-cvbzfahsek)      [Click here for more solar panel options](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/solar-panels.html)** | ## Flexible Solar Panels  [![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/100w-mono-3-1001x1001-crop-center_orig.jpg)](https://richsolar.com/collections/flexible-solar-panels/products/100-watt-flexible-solar-panel)  **Pros:** - Lightweight - Easy to mount - Aerodynamic efficiency (they are designed to be flush mounted on your roof, which means better gas mileage for your vehicle. **Cons:** - Longevity issues. Typical life is 5-10 years. (Glass panels can last 25 years+) - Expensive - Cheap materials (and connectors) - They can bend.. but not too much. Anything more than a 30 degree radius will cause damage of the solar cells ( you will hear a distinct crunch, and you may see cracks in the cells) - They like to over heat. If you are in arizona, they will die in less than a year. If you use them in a cool environment, 5-10 years is average. **[4x 100 watts of Flexible Solar Panels   Click here to purchase](https://richsolar.com/collections/flexible-solar-panels/products/100-watt-flexible-solar-panel)** |

## Renogy DC DC Battery Charger w/ MPPT

| ![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/fireshot-capture-385-www-renogy-com_orig.png) | This thing is awesome! It controls charging from your alternator and solar panels. Dead simple to install, and easy to program (just use a paper clip to press the "type" button and you are set. Takes five seconds!)      This charger can handle 600 watts of solar power no problem, but stick with 400 watts so that the mc4 wires and adapters current limitations are not exceeded.      If you are using a lead acid battery with this charger, be sure to plug in the temperature sensor and attach it to the solar battery.

Best bang for the buck lithium battery around! - Low Temperature Protection. Every other battery at this price point does not have low temperature cut off. This one does! - This battery will last 3,000 to 5,000+ cycles. It is small and light weight.    **[230Ah Li Time Battery Click Here to Purchase](https://www.litime.com/products/litime-12v-230ah-plus-lifepo4-battery-built-in-200a-bms-max-2944wh-energy?ref=XBIA62RFcalHns)**      [If you need a cheaper battery, click here for more options](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/lithium-batteries.html) |

## Choose an inverter:

| ## Modified Sine Wave Inverter  ![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/71ywfuubtzl-ac-sl1500_1.jpg)  [2000 watt modified sine wave inverter   (modified sine wave will power 95% of AC appliances. they also cause appliances to have a small humming noise. Induction loads (such as microwaves and motors) run with an added 30% loss in efficiency.      A lot of people still use these inverters, but most people would prefer a pure sine wave inverter.      **Click Here to purchase**](https://amzn.to/2PVStnt) | ## Pure Sine Wave Inverter (recommended)  [![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/81fvycdyqul-ac-sl1500_orig.jpg)](https://amzn.to/3613z0p)  [2200 watt pure sine wave inverter   (pure sine wave inverters are better and more efficient, and work with all AC electronics)      Pure sine wave is the way to go. They cost more initially but work much better!      **Click Here to purcahse**](https://amzn.to/3613z0p) |

| ![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/mc4-branch-4-1-mmmf-iso-4-2048x1152_orig.png)  [![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/61t3qqe2nfl-ac-sl1000_orig.jpg)](https://www.renogy.com/solar-mc4-y-parallel-branch-connectors-mffff-fmmmm-pair/) | **Branch Connector**   Wiring multiple panels together requires a branch connector. Connect all of your panels together on the roof and combine them into two wires which will connect to the solar panel extension cable (Solar panel to charge controller cable above)      Important Installation Note: This branch adapter can handle 30 amps. MC4 cannot. So the solar panel to branch adapter are good to go. But the connection between the branch adapter and solar charge controller should not have a mc4. Use a 8 or 10 gauge wire to connect them instead.      [mc-4 branch connector   (1x pair required for 400 watt system)   Click Here](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/mc4-branch/?ref=wp) |

| [![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/51-ki3c3xgl-ac-sl1000_orig.jpg)](https://www.renogy.com/mc4-waterproof-in-line-fuse-holder-w-fuse/?afmc=6q) | Because this blueprint unfortunately requires parallel connection of the solar panels (which I dislike, but the charge controller voltage is quite limited), then you need to add an inline mc4 fuse to your individual solar panels. This is not the case in series strings. But because this blueprint requires so many solar panels in parallel, adding a inline mc4 fuse is very smart to do.      **[Click Here to buy 4x 15A inline MC-4 fuses](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/solar-mc4-15a-inline-fuse/?ref=wp)**      To install, add it to the mc4 connections of each individual solar panel. Takes seconds, and can prevent problems in the future. |

| **Solar Panel Cable Entry Gland**      When your solar panel array wires enter your vehicle, you will need to drill two holes. Use this cover to prevent roof leaks from developing.

## Required fuses, fuse blocks, bus bars and Circuit breakers:

| ## Battery Bank To Inverter/Fuse Block Main Fuse  \| ![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/fuseholderkit-cropped_orig.png) \| Stick to these fuses if you do not want to have problems with your 12V system. High disconnect current rating and works with 48V.      **How to size an MegaFuse for 12V inverters (or any appliance really):** 1. Take the continous wattage rating on the inverter and divide it by the voltage it operates at (12V) 2. Let's say you have a 1500W 12V inverter. The maximum amperage it requires is 1500(W)/ 12(V) = 125 (Amps) 3. Take the maximum current (125Amps in this situation) and multiple it by 1.25. 125 X 1.25 = 156.25 4. You need a fuse that can handle 156.25A. But they only make 150A and 200A fuses. So what you will need to do is round up to 200A fuse. Be sure to use inverter cables that can handle 200A, so if a fault were to occur, the cables can carry 200A to the fuse.       **[100 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v+100A&ref=wp)      [150 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v+150A&ref=wp)      [175 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v%20175A&ref=wp)      [200 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v+200A&ref=wp)      [250 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v+250A&ref=wp)      [300 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v+300A&ref=wp)** \| \| --- \| --- \| | ## Fuse Block  \| [![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/published/91ef-cg4r5l-sl1500_8.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2r4MqkG) \| [Connect 12 volt appliances here   Click here](http://amzn.to/2r4MqkG) \| \| --- \| --- \| |
