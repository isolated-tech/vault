## 400 watt Solar System Blueprint

Warning: Please read my book for full installation instructions and safety considerations!!

Step 1: Mount components to a wooden board like this:

![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/published/website-design-solar-system.jpg?1544471709)

This picture should give you a rough idea of how to mount and connect your components. Each system is different though, so be sure to use my book to calculate the fuse and wire gauge size for your components. This picture does not cover other remote wires/shunts/temperature compensation wires etc, so please be sure to use my book to understand how this all works!

---

Step 2: Connect the Battery Bank

If everything is installed correctly, the solar charge controller should now turn on, and you should be able to run the inverter. You may see a small spark when you connect the inverter to a battery, and this is completely normal.

## Step 3: Mount Solar Panels to the roof and Connect them to Solar Charge Controller

If you follow the previous steps correctly, the solar charge controller should now be charging your battery! (if there is sunshine present)  
For more information on how to do this, please check out my book:)

Connect all of your panels together on the roof and combine them into two wires which will connect to the solar panel extension cable (Solar panel to charge controller cable above)      [2 wire mc-4 branch connector   (1x pair required for 400 watt system)   Click Here](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/mc4-branch/) |

## Required fuses, fuse blocks, bus bars and circuit breakers:

## Battery Bank To Inverter/Fuse Block Main Fuse

| ![Picture](https://www.mobile-solarpower.com/uploads/1/2/9/6/12964626/fuseholderkit-cropped_orig.png) | MegaFuses work great and cost very little money, and are preferred over the typical ANL fuse you would find from most solar distributors. Unlike ANL, Megafuses can be used with 24V/48V systems and have a higher disconnect amperage. Stick to these fuses if you do not want to have problems with your 12V system.      **How to size an MegaFuse for 12V inverters (or any appliance really):** 1. Take the continous wattage rating on the inverter and divide it by the voltage it operates at (12V) 2. Let's say you have a 1500W 12V inverter. The maximum amperage it requires is 1500(W)/ 12(V) = 125 (Amps) 3. Take the maximum current (125Amps in this situation) and multiple it by 1.25. 125 X 1.25 = 156.25 4. You need a fuse that can handle 156.25A. But they only make 150A and 200A fuses. So what you will need to do is round up to 200A fuse. Be sure to use inverter cables that can handle 200A, so if a fault were to occur, the cables can carry 200A to the fuse.       **[100 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v+100A&ref=wp)      [150 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v+150A&ref=wp)      [175 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v%20175A&ref=wp)      [200 Amp Fuse and Holder (recommended for 2,200W inverter)](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v+200A&ref=wp)      [250 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v+250A&ref=wp)      [300 Amp Fuse and Holder](https://www.currentconnected.com/product/megabundle/?attribute_fuse-rating=32v+300A&ref=wp)** |
